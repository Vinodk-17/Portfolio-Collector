                        <p>Small companies and start-ups typically follow the simple structure. With this structure, the owner is also the manager and minutely manages every aspect of the business. Employees often work in several operational areas, and their departmental structure and area of expertise may not be well-defined. The company also may not have standard operating procedures and policies. The departments and operating procedures evolve with time as the company grows bigger and has to hire more employees. With the expansion of a business, employees' roles must be distinctly outlined, and companies may need to adopt more complex organizational structures to maintain operational efficiency..</p>

                        <p>Every company needs to define a clear line of command for efficient operation. Employees must have well-defined job descriptions so that their tasks do not overlap and create confusion. There are several organizational structure models that have been proposed for different types of businesses. Before selecting one of the models, you must make sure that the model accounts for all of your current employees and that it covers all of your employeesâ€™ daily tasks. Popular organizational formats include simple, functional and divisional structures.!</p>
